# ElasticJBalancer
An elastic load balancer implemented in Java.

ElasticJBalancer can not only automatically scale up and scale down workers based on the number of incoming requests, but also predict the number of incoming requests using machine learning algorithm REPTree, which is the best model based on our experiments. ElasticJBalancer allocates the incoming requests to workers based on the monitoring information of resource usage and the peak prediction. We use parallelism to implement ElasticJBalancer in one node. The goal of ElasticJBalancer is to balance load generated by huge clients across worker nodes.
